Currently (at least) the following is missing:
 * Definitions for all important entities (in def/), especially:
   func_*, info_*, path_*, trigger_*, target_*
 
 * GUIs, especially a main menu would be nice.

 * Examples for:
   - Player model (incl. corresponding definitions etc)
   - Melee weapon, e.g. stick, (incl. scripts)
   - Firewarm, e.g. Pistol, Gun, ... (incl. scripts)
   - one or more enemies (incl. models, scripts etc; could reuse player model)

 * OpenGL Shaders to replace the stuff from Doom3's glprogs/ directory
   (maybe one of the GLSL implementations + shaders could be improved)
 
 * A script that replaces deprecated materials with their alternatives would be nice.

Everything in this SDK should be under a free license that also allows commercial
use, e.g. WTFPL (http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/), a BSD-like license or a permissive
CC License (e.g. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US).
GPL may also be ok, but I'm trying to avoid that to make using the included assets
easier for projects that use other non-free assets.
